A projected created using LibGDX for an asynchronous multiplayer minesweeper game based off the MSN game Minesweeper: Battle. The project works on Desktop and Android devices, as well as potentially iOS devices but untested. 

The SQL used for the database communication is in a separate folder in the root of the project called SQL. In reality these files should be hosted on a web server. The project is setup to use my default hosting for testing. N.B passwords are not encrypted in the database.

The project is built with an engine I created in LibGDX during the development of a mobile game I released called [FlyBy](http://www.nathanmwilliams.com/?cat=3)
